Repository for experiment on revolve robots (https://github.com/kgd-al/revolve2) 
with sensory inputs (mostly camera).
Control is effected by an Artificial Neural Network obtained via NeuroEvolution (https://github.com/kgd-al/abrain)

Camera input relies on OpenGL. Currently EGL and OSMESA are "supported"
dependencies (ubuntu):
 - [osmesa] libgl1-mesa-glx libosmesa6
 - [egl] ?
